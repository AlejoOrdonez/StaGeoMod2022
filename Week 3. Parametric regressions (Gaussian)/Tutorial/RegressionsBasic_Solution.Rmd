# Before you start.

Paruelo & Lauenroth (1996) analysed the geographic distribution and the effects of climate variables on the relative abundance of a number of plant functional types (PFTs), including shrubs, forbs, succulents (e.g. cacti), C3 grasses and C4 grasses. The latter two PFTs represent grasses that utilise the C from the atmosphere differently in photosynthesis and are expected to respond differently to CO~2~ and climate change. They used data from 73 sites across temperate central North America and calculated the relative abundance of a series of plant functional types (PFTs), including C3 grasses and C4 grasses.

They analysed the geographic distribution and the effects of climate variables on the relative abundance of C3 and C4 grasses. **Here, you will only focus on C3 plants** and you will use the log-transformed variable (`LC3`). Why use the log-transformed relative abundance?, the relative abundances were positively skewed hence needed to be transformed using a log~10~(x+0.1) transformation (log~10~(C3+0.1)), so you can do a least-squares regression (a more detailed explanation for this will come in the next class).

Predictor variables used to describe each evaluated site included the latitude in centesimal degrees (`LAT`), the longitude in centesimal degrees (`LONG`), the mean annual precipitation in mm (`MAP`), the mean annual temperature in C (`MAT`), the proportion of `MAP` that fell in June, July and August (`JJAMAP`) and the proportion of `MAP` that fell in December, January and February (`DJFMAP`).

# Data Exploration: Assessing the information at hand

Now that you have the data on relative abundance and climate variables contained in the paruelo.csv file, it is time to explore the dataset.

In the context of linear regression (that, to be clear, refers to the way parameters are used in the model and not to the type of relationships that are modelled), you need to know whether there are linear or non-linear patterns between response and explanatory variables.

You also need to know whether the data are balanced before including interactions. By balanced, I mean that the number of observations for all possible combinations of interacting variables (e.g., Sex X Age) is similar.

Although data exploration is an essential part of any analysis, it must be separated from hypothesis testing. Decisions about what models to test should be made a priori based on the researcherâ€™s biological understanding of the system. However, data exploration can be used as a hypothesis-generating exercise (i.e., data mining/dredging).

The process you will now take focuses on describing patterns in the data (i.e., outliers and distributions of the response and predictor variables); and assessing eight (8) patterns linked to the five assumptions on a 'linear' regression:

1) **The relation between the response and predictors is linear**. 

2) **The residuals have constant variance at every level of x**.

3) **The residuals of the model are normally distributed**.

4) **No or little multicollinearity between predictors**.

5) **The observations are independent**.

With that in mind, you are now ready to start your data exploration.

# Data Exploration: oultiers in X and Y - 1

In most statistical regression techniques, the results are dominated by outliers. Consequently, the researcher must understand how a particular approach responds to the presence of outliers. As a reminder, an *outlier* is an observation with a relatively large or small value compared to most observations.

A graphical tool typically used for outlier detection is the box-plot (implemented in `R` using the `boxplot ()` function). It visualises the median and the spread of the data.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Your task:**

Using the `paruelo` data, you will now build a box plot for each predictor variable described in the **Before you start** section. You will also add a "title" to each plot using the `main` argument.

</div>


```{r Outlier1}
# Build 3x2 plotting space filled row-wise 
par(mfrow = c(3,2), mar=rep(2,4)) 

# Make a box-plot for MAP
boxplot(paruelo$MAP,
        main = "MAP") # adds a "title" to the figure with the name of the plotted variable 

# Make a box-plot for MAT
boxplot(paruelo$MAT,
        main = "MAT") # adds a "title" to the figure with the name of the plotted variable 

# Make a box-plot for JJAMAP
boxplot(paruelo$JJAMAP,
        main = "JJAMAP") # adds a "title" to the figure with the name of the plotted variable 

# Make a box-plot for DJFMAP
boxplot(paruelo$DJFMAP,
        main = "DJFMAP") # adds a "title" to the figure with the name of the plotted variable 

# Make a box-plot for LONG
boxplot(paruelo$LONG,
        main = "LONG") # adds a "title" to the figure with the name of the plotted variable 

# Make a box-plot for LAT
boxplot(paruelo$LAT,
        main = "LAT") # adds a "title" to the figure with the name of the plotted variable 
```
<div class="alert alert-success">
**Question: For which variable can you detect outlier observation**
When you check the box-plots for all evaluated variables, you do not see any outlieres,
</div>

# Data Exploration: oultiers in X and Y - 2

Another very useful but highly neglected graphical tool to
visualise outliers is the Cleveland dot-plot - a graph in which the row of an observation is plotted against the observation value. Cleveland dot-plots provide much more detailed information than a box-plot. Points that stick out on the right-hand side or the left-hand side are observed values that are considerably larger or smaller than most of the observations and require further investigation.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Your task:**

Using the data from the `paruelo`, you will build a Cleveland dot plot for each predictor variable. But this time you will use a `for()` loop to create the figure.

A key feature of Cleveland dot-plots is that the data is sorted (for this, you need to use the `sort()` function). So you will need to create an ordered object with observations before creating the plot.

</div>


```{r Outlier3}
# Build 3x2 plotting space filled row-wise 
par(mfrow = c(3,2), mar=rep(4,4)) # here you define the 'margins" - blank space between plotting areas)

# Create an object named PredNames that has the names of the variables you want to plot.
PredNames <- c("MAP","MAT","JJAMAP", "DJFMAP", "LONG","LAT")  

# initialize your loop using i as an iterator and cycling through PredNames (which is in the memory)
for (i in PredNames){ # Here you need specify a object `in` range of values 
# Create and object names EvalVar with the variables of interest
  EvalVar <- paruelo[,i]
# Sort the EvalVar object in increasing order for this you need to use the function sort() and the decreasing argument
  EvalVar <- sort(x = EvalVar, # Variable to sort
                  decreasing = F) # increasing or decreasing?
#plot the Sorted variable of interest
   plot(EvalVar, # Variable to plot
        pch = 19,cex=0.5, # Filled circles of half size
        main = i ) # add a title to the plot

# Data Exploration: Is there homogeneity of variances - 1?

Homogeneity of variance is an essential assumption in the analysis of variance (ANOVA), other regression-related models and multivariate techniques like discriminant analysis. In the **paruelo** dataset case, assessing if the relative abundance of C3 is affected by environmental conditions and/or spatial gradients variation in the relative abundance of C3 observations is similar across the range of the evaluated predictor variables (that is what *homoscedasticity* means).

The problem is that in regression-type analyses, verification of homogeneity of variances is done after you build the regression model by using the model's residuals. For this, you will plot the residuals vs. the fitted values or vs. predictors (in the case of categorical predictors, these plots will be conditional box-plots).

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Your task:**

Here you will evaluate if the variance in the relative abundance of C3 observations is homogeneous across all predictors. **Remember that the response variable here is `LC3`**. For this, you will assess this assumption for each of the six predictors individually. Like before, use a loop to determine homoscedasticity of C3 relative abundance across predictors.

* Is the variance of relative abundance of C3 observations homoscedastic for individual variables?

# Data Exploration: Are the residuals normally distributed?

Various statistical techniques assume normality. A blind read of this assumption can lead to the production of histogram after histogram of the evaluated data. However,what is essential to know is *what exactly is assumed to be normally distributed on a given statistical technique*. In linear regression, what is assumed is the normality of all the replicate observations at a particular covariate value. Still, the technique is reasonably robust against violation of the assumption. In the case of comparison text like ANOVAs and simple t-tests, the observations in each group need to be normally distributed; hence you should examine histograms for the raw data of every group.

Now let's go back to the linear regression. You cannot verify the normality assumption unless one has many replicates at each sampled covariate value. However, *normality of the raw data implies normality of the residuals*. Therefore, you can make histograms of residuals (using the `hist()` or `density()` functions) to get some impression of normality even though you cannot fully test the assumption.

# Data Exploration: Is there collinearity among the covariates? - 1

Suppose the underlying question in a study is which predictors (also named covariates in a multiple regression framework) determine the changes in a response variable. In that case, the biggest problem to overcome is often **collinearity** - the existence of a correlation between covariates. Typical examples are covariates like weight and length or water depth and distance to the shoreline.

If collinearity is ignored, one is likely to end up with a confusing statistical analysis in which nothing is significant, but were dropping one covariate can make the others significant or even change the sign of estimated parameters.

Although here I discussed the effect of collinearity in the context of multiple linear regression,  similar problems exist in other statistical analyses linking multiple predictors (e.g., analysis of variance, mixed-effects models, RDA, CCA, GLMs or GAMs). Two important points of clarification are:

1) Collinearity **ONLY** considers the **predictors/covariates**.
2) Collinearity analyses try to assess the information in one predictors/covariates is is already contained in the sample data for another(s).

*How to assess the level of collinearity between variables?* One way is to assess the correlations between predictors/covariates, as it provides a first approximation to the level of redundancy. This means assessing all pairwise correlations between predictors/covariates, which in simple models is feasible, but becomes complicated as the number of predictors/covariates increases.

# Data Exploration: Is there collinearity among the covariates? - 2

The issue with the methods above is that they become cumbersome when you have many predictors and can only evaluate pairs of these at a time. A more robust and objective way to assess collinearity is to estimate the tolerance (or its' inverse, the variance inflation index or VIF). You can think of these indexes as the measurement of the "redundancy" of predictors, given the information contained in the other predictors.

The tolerance and variance inflation index are assessed with the model R^2^, where all the other covariates explain a given predictor. The term R~j~^2^ is the R^2^ from a linear regression model in which covariate X~j~ is used as a response variable and all other covariates as explanatory variables. A high R^2^ in such a model means that most of the variation in covariate X~j~ is explained by all other covariates, which means there is collinearity.

The tolerance for a predictor X~j~ is simply 1 - R^2^ from the regression of X~j~ against the remaining predictor variables. The VIF merely is the inverse of the tolerance (1 / (1 - R^2^)). An approximate guide is to worry is a tolerance value of less than 0.1 (that is, a VIF > than 10). That means 90% of the variation in X~j~ is explained by the other variables. A more stringent approach is considered tolerance problematic for values lower than 0.3 (VIF values larger than thee).

One strategy for addressing the collinearity problem is to sequentially drop the covariate with the lowest tolerance, recalculate the tolerance and repeat this process until all Tolerances are larger than a preselected threshold (0.1 or 0.33).


<div class="alert alert-info">
**Your task:**

# Use a for loop across predictors (remember the names are in PredNames) to estimate the tolerance.

# Create new data.frame named Tol.DF was the first variable tested.
  Tol.DF <- data.frame(Pred = paruelo[,i], # the data of the predictor variable being tested should be included here  - call it using the i iterator.

# Data Exploration: What are the relationships between `Y` and `X` variables?

Another essential part of data exploration, especially in univariate analysis, is plotting the response variable vs. each predictor. *Why do this?* mainly to assess the possible patterns between the response and explanatory variables. However, it is essential to note that the absence of clear patterns does not mean any relationships! It means that there are no clear two-way (response to one predictor) relationships. A model with multiple explanatory variables may still provide a good fit.

Besides visualising relationships between variables, scatter plots are also useful to detect observations that do not comply with the general pattern between two variables. Here notice any observation that sticks out from the cloud of observations - these need(s) further investigation. Such "odd" values might indicate, for example, different species, measurement errors, typing mistakes, or they may be correct values after all.

# Data Exploration: Are observations of the response variable independent?

A crucial assumption of most statistical techniques is that observations are independent of one another, meaning that information from anyone observation should not provide information on another after the effects of other variables have been accounted for.

Examples of when you do not have independence in the observation are when samples are taken "to close" to each other - locations close to each other have characteristics that are more similar to each other than those from locations separated by larger distances. This "similarity" is a violation of the independence assumption. Another example is when multiple individuals of the same family (e.g. all of the young from one nest) are sampled; these individuals might be more similar to each other than random individuals in the population because they share a similar genetic make-up and similar parental provisioning history.

When such dependence arises, the statistical model used to analyse the data needs to account for it via modelling any spatial or temporal relationships or by nesting data in a hierarchical structure - *something I will talk about later in the course*.

Testing for independence, however, is not always easy. The best and simplest way is to assess if the model residuals contain any dependence structure (if you see **heteroscedasticity**, then there is likely a dependence structure). Quite often, a residual correlation structure is caused by an important covariate that was not measured. If this is the case, it may not be possible to resolve the problem.

You can use space to assess independence by plotting the response variable vs. spatial coordinates (`LAT` and `LON`). If you had a time series, you con them plot the response variable vs. time. These plots are called variograms (for irregularly spaced time series and spatial data) or auto-correlation functions (ACF) for regularly spaced time series/spatial data.

# Multiple Linear Regressions - first implementation

The essence of regression analysis is using sample data to estimate parameter values and their standard errors. The thing to understand is that there is nothing difficult or mysterious about estimating the regression parameters. In `R` using the `lm()` function  (which stands for â€˜linear modelâ€™; note that the first letter of the function name `lm` is a lower case L, not a number one) is the simplest way to do this. All you need do is tell `R` which of the variables is the response variable and which is (are) the explanatory variable(s). The response variable goes on the left of the tilde `âˆ¼`, and the explanatory variable(s) go on the right, like this: `y âˆ¼ x1 + x2 + x3`. When you execute the `lm()` function, you can also specify where the data is coming from using the `data` argument.

*So where does `R` get its coefficients from?* you need to do some calculations to find this out. However, the important thing is to remember that what you want are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. That is to say that, given the data and having selected a linear model, and you want to find the values of the slope(s) and intercept that make the data most likely. 

The difference between each data point and the value predicted by the model at the same value of x is called a residual. Some residuals are positive (above the line), and others are negative (below the line). These residuals describe the goodness of fit of the regression line. Your maximum likelihood model is defined as *the model that minimises the sum of the squares of these residuals*.

# Multiple Linear Regressions - standardised regression coefficients

Standardised (regression) coefficients, also called beta coefficients or beta weights, are the estimates resulting from a regression analysis where the underlying data have been standardised so that the variances of dependent and independent variables are equal to 1. Therefore, ** standardised coefficients are unit-less and refer to how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change, per standard deviation increase in the predictor variable**.

*Why do you need to do this?* Standardisation of the coefficient is usually done to answer the question of which of the independent variables have a greater effect on the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis where the variables are measured in different units of measurement (for example, income measured in dollars and family size measured in the number of individuals). It may also be considered a general measure of effect size, quantifying the "magnitude" of the effect of one variable on another. The standardised regression coefficient equals the correlation between the independent and dependent variables for simple linear regression with orthogonal predictors.

There are two ways of generating standardised regression coefficients:

1) A regression carried out on standardised variables produces standardised coefficients.

2) Rescale the un-standardised coefficients ($\beta_{x}$) obtained from a regression carried out on original (un-standardised) variables by dividing the coefficient by the ratio between the predictor ($S{x}$) and  response ($S{y}$) standard deviation ($\beta_{x-std}=\frac{S{x}}{S{x}}*\beta_{x}$).

# Multiple Linear Regressions - How good is my model

In statistics, the coefficient of determination denoted R^2^ or r^2^ and pronounced *R squared* is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). **In a general form, R^2^ can be seen to be related to the fraction of variance explained by the model**.

It is a statistic used in the context of statistical models whose main purpose is to either predict future outcomes or test hypotheses based on other related information. It measures how well-observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

For a simple linear regression, r^2^ is used instead of R^2^. When an intercept is included, then r^2^ is simply the square of the sample correlation coefficient (i.e., Pearson correlation) between the observed outcomes and the observed predictor values. If multiple predictors are included, R^2^ is the square of the coefficient of multiple correlations. In both such cases, the coefficient of determination normally ranges from 0 to 1.

The use of an adjusted R^2^ (one common notation is $\overline{R^2}$, pronounced "R bar squared"; another is R^2^~adj~) is an attempt to account for the phenomenon of the R^2^ automatically and spuriously increasing when extra explanatory variables are added to the model.

The adjusted R^2^ can be negative, and its value will always be less than or equal to that of R^2^. Unlike R^2^, the adjusted R^2^ increases only when the increase in R^2^ (due to the inclusion of a new explanatory variable) is more than one would expect to see by chance.

Adjusted R^2^ can be interpreted as a less biased estimator of the population R^2^, whereas the observed sample R^2^ is a positively biased estimate of the population value. Adjusted R^2^ is more appropriate when evaluating model fit (the variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables) and comparing alternative models in the feature selection stage of model building.

# Multiple Linear Regressions - Minimum Adequate Model

Fitting models to data is the central function of R. The process is essentially one of exploration; there are no fixed rules and no absolutes. The object is to determine a minimal adequate model from the large set of potential models that might be used to describe the given set of data.

The stepwise progression from the saturated/maximal model (one with all variables and interactions ) through a series of simplifications to the minimal adequate model is made based on deletion/addition tests. These are F-tests or chi-squared tests that assess the significance of the increase in fit due to a given term being removed/added from the current model. This process is named **stepwise selection**, with forward stepwise selection when variables are added sequentially to a model; and backwards stepwise selection when variables are sequentially removed.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Your task:**

Run a forward selection procedure. For each process, extract the regression coefficients of the reduced model.

FrwdSel <- step(Stdz.Model, # an object representing a model to simplify
                direction = "forward") # forward or backward
#extract the regression coefficients using the function coef()
coef(FrwdSel)
#Get the adjusted R-squared
summary(FrwdSel)$adj.r.squared

```{r MAM2}

BackSel <- step(Stdz.Model, # an object representing a model to simplify

#extract the regression coefficients using the function coef()
coef(BackSel)

# Multiple Linear Regressions - Last points

Here, you started by considering the main points to consider when doing regression analyses. This is important as it assesses fundamental questions: is the underlying data appropriate for a given analysis. By assessing this, you can avoid the problems that can lead to statistical
models that are wrong. The systematic data exploration presented here is necessary before embarking on the analysis stage of your project.

Once you know what you can do, it is important to know that there is no simple formula for finding the minimal adequate model, but there are steps to take:
1) Create a full factorial model of your data.
2) Begin to look for the best model that fits the data.
3) Confirm â€™s choices with your stepwise deletion procedure.
4) When you have found the best fit, check the modelâ€™s normality and constant variances assumptions.
