# **StaGeoMod2022 week 8 -[Landsat Data in R]**

## Objectives of this week.

1.	Download LANDSAT data form the USGS [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov) website.
2.  Visualize the Multiband infortion using diferent combintions of bands.


## Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models (GLMMs) in a nutshell

Landsat is the name of a joint NASA/USGS program that provides repetitive, calibrated, satellite-based observations of the earth at a spatial resolution that enables analysis of man's interaction with the environment. (NASA 2021). Landsat 8 and 9 capture data in 11 different bands, giving Landsat 8 and 9 a spectral resolution that includes visible light, near-infrared, short wave infrared, and thermal infrared bands (USGS 2017).

These bands can be visualized in different ways. the most common are:
