# **StaGeoMod2022 week 7 -[Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models Squares (GLMM)]**

## Objectives of this week.

1.	Implement as Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model that considers the nested structure of the data.
3.  Select the best way to model random effects.
4.	Reduce a Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Model to the minimum adequate number of predictors using a stepwise procedure.

## Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models (GLMMs) in a nutshell

Where basic statistical methods try to quantify the exact effects of each predictor variable, Ecological and Evolutinary problems often involve random effects, whose purpose is instead to quantify the variation among units. The most familiar types of random effect are the blocks in experiments or observational studies that are replicated across sites or times. Random effects also encompass variation among individuals (when multiple responses are measured per individual, such as survival of multiple offspring or sex ratios of multiple broods), genotypes, species and regions or time periods.

A mixed model, mixed-effects model or mixed error-component model is a statistical model containing both fixed effects and random effects.These models are useful in a wide variety of disciplines in the physical, biological and social sciences. They are particularly useful in settings where repeated measurements are made on the same statistical units (longitudinal study), or where measurements are made on clusters of related statistical units. Because of their advantage in dealing with missing values, mixed effects models are often preferred over more traditional approaches such as repeated measures analysis of variance.
