# **StaGeoMod2022 - week 0 -[A refresher to the use of `R`]**

## Objectives of this week.

1.	Know the Basics of arithmetical with R.
2.	Discriminate between R objects types and information classes.
3.  Create different type of `R` objects and know how to manipulate these.
4.  Be able to subset and address the elements within a `R` object.
5.	Understand the use of factors.


## Why we use R?  

Manly because `R` is the best statistical programming language of the world. Also, `R` can help you make your analysis as transparent as possible, and eliminate the need to rerun the it constantly, and regenerate graphs that incorporate that pesky “one more fix”. Just think of this, the number of studies reported using `R` as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4% in 2008 to 58.0% in 2017 [Lai et al (2019) Ecosphere](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2567). The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared.

Furthermore, because of its transparent and flexible nature, `R` is increasingly used for data management and analysis in all disciplines that deal with data. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor's degree and a required knowledge of `R` have increased over the past ten years.

Also you need to remember that `R` and **RStudio** are two separate pieces of software:

* `R` is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis

*  **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.

## What is Rmarkdown?

[`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) is a simple and easy to use plain text language used to combine your `R` code, results from your data analysis (including plots and tables) and written commentary into a single nicely formatted and reproducible document (like a report, publication, thesis chapter or a web page like this one). `R Markdown` documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats. That is the reason why we will be using it in our course.

Technically, `R markdown` is a variant of another language called **Markdown** and both are a type of *"markup"* language. A markup language simply provides a way of creating an easy to read plain text file which can incorporate formatted text, images, headers and links to other documents. `R markdown` is very easy to learn and when used with **RStudio* even easier to integrate into your workflow to produce feature rich content.0
