# **StaGeoMod2022 - week 1 -[Exploratory data analysis (EDA)]**

## Objectives of this week.

1.	Graphically explore the variability in the variables in a data set based.  
2.	Graphically compare the variables values between two categorical groups  
3.	Determine the correlation between two random variables and the significance of such correlation.  
4.	Establish the normality of a variable.

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a nutshell  

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is when a person manipulates data to learn about general patterns or tendencies and find specific occurrences that deviate from the general patterns. Many statisticians have devised a collection of methods helpful in exploring data. However, specific data analysis techniques are helpful. Exploratory data analysis is more than the methods – it represents an attitude or philosophy about exploring data.

EDA is an iterative cycle that helps you understand what your data says. When you do EDA, you:

1. Generate questions about your data
2. Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and/or modelling your data
3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

EDA is an essential part of any data analysis. You can use EDA to make discoveries about the world, or you can use EDA to ensure the quality of your data, asking questions about whether the data meets your standards or not.

Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset. It helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.

EDA is, fundamentally, a creative process. Like most creative processes, the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large number of questions. It is challenging to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights are contained in your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will highlight a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most exciting parts of your data—and develop a set of thought-provoking questions—if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.
